They provide a series of different methods for scanning and analyzing files for hidden data \u2014 an important process in digital forensic investigations and cybersecurity assessments.</p> <p>This is the main function that takes an input PDF file. It extracts images, performs steganalysis, finds all images in the current directory, processes each one, fetches all WAV files, runs <code>stegwav</code> for each, followed by white space steganography detection. Additionally, it plots entropy changes, delays for 2 seconds, then prints the directory tree.</p>"},{"location":"steganalysis/run_binwalk/","title":"<code>run_binwalk</code> Function","text":"<p>The binwalk tool is invoked here, a tool for searching binary files like images and audio files for embedded files and executable code.</p> <p>This function checks for <code>binwalk</code> in the PATH and if not found, logs an error message and suggests the installation command.
