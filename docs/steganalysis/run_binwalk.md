# `run_binwalk` Function

The binwalk tool is invoked here, a tool for searching binary files like images and audio files for embedded files and executable code.

This function checks for `binwalk` in the PATH and if not found, logs an error message and suggests the installation command. If `binwalk` exists, runs `binwalk` on the given file path, the tool stores the output.
