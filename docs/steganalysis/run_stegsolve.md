# `run_stegsolve` Function

Stegsolve is an open-source tool often used for steganalysis, particularly in the field of CTF (Capture The Flag) challenges. It works by applying various manipulations to images (like image bit planes) to reveal hidden content.

This function searches for `stegsolve` in the PATH. If it doesn't exist, it logs an error message and ends. If `stegsolve` exists, it's used to run Stegsolve on the given image path and the result is stored.
